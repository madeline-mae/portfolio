# Madeline Smith's Portfolio Viewer

## Introduction

Hello, this is Garrett. I've created this Portfolio Viewer for Madeline. The purpose of this project is to showcase Madeline's exceptional work in a user-friendly and efficient manner. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript powered by PDF.js, this simple yet effective web interface loads her portfolio quickly and elegantly.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile views.
- **Lazy Loading**: Utilizes PDF.js to only load pages as needed, providing a faster user experience.
- **Single Page Application**: Everything exists within a single HTML file for ease of deployment and maintenance.
  
## How to Use

1. **Visit the Site**: Open the website where this portfolio is hosted.
2. **View Portfolio**: Click the "View Portfolio" button.
3. **Navigate**: The first page will load initially. Additional features like scrolling through pages can be added upon requirement.

## Technical Stack

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic loading and rendering of the PDF.
- **PDF.js**: A JavaScript library for rendering PDFs in the browser.

## Deployment

The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing a reliable and straightforward hosting solution. It's a single HTML file, so deployment is as easy as uploading the file to the appropriate GitHub repository.

## Final Thoughts

I've always been a proponent of humane technology that is simple, effective, and empowers users. This portfolio viewer aims to make Madeline's impressive work accessible and engaging without compromising on loading speed or user experience.
